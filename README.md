# Fundamentals Project

This repository contains two jupyter notebooks.

pyplot.ipynb contains an overview of the matplotlib.pyplot python package. In this notbook I created three examples of random data and use plots to analyse them.

cao.ipynb shows how to load the CAO points information from the official website into a pandas data frame. Then I compare the CAO points from 2019, 2020 and 2021.
