## How to run a notebook:

***

1. Download [Anaconda]().

3. Run `jupyter lab`. 


## Pyplot:


### Example 1 
This example uses a horizontal bar chart to show which city is most popular. The vertical axis represents the cities being compared while the horizontal axis reveals the popularity of each city. 

In order to create the data functions such as random.seed() .... etc were used. 



### Example 2
This example uses histograms showing a distribution of random numbers using the random.normal() and random.seed() functions



### Example 3
This scatterplot shows randomly chosen bus arrival times and relative probabilities. 



### Example 4
This is a pie chart about favourite pets.



## Pandas:

Using pandas to compare CAO points in the last three years.
