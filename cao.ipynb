    "As I began plotting the data from this dataset it became apparent that there were still issues with the data from 2019. As I struggled to plot the data alonside the other years I found an interesting blog post from someone who had a similar issue over four years ago. The suggestion found in this [blog](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44530047/why-is-my-numeric-data-being-treated-as-an-object) was that when converting from a PDF to a CSV file, the data may have lost it's data type. I decided to test this theory on my dataset by using the [pandas DataFrame dtype](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.dtypes.html) function which returns the data type of each columns."

You pass in the argumnet to be converted which in this case is the column points_r1_2019. Then it returns the data as a float or integer depending on the origional argument. Another important note is that I am using the errors paramenter in this function as some rows within this column don't hold any points as that course may not have been offered that year or maybe there was a portfolio or interview instead. Therefore, by selecting coerce it will set any invalid rows to [NaN](https://towardsdatascience.com/5-methods-to-check-for-nan-values-in-in-python-3f21ddd17eed#:~:text=How%20to%20check%20if%20a%20single%20value%20is%20NaN%20in%20python.&text=NaN%20stands%20for%20Not%20A,major%20problems%20in%20Data%20Analysis.) which means it's not a number.

    "In this table we can see that in 2020 there were 1394 courses offered which is 471 more than 2021 and 503 more than 2019. This would suggest a sudden rise in courses and and then a sudden drop. Interestingly, this coincedies with the current [coronovirus pandemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic_in_the_Republic_of_Ireland) which first began in Ireland in February 2020. The [CAO's deadline](https://www.cao.ie/#:~:text=Closing%20Date%20for%20Applications%20is%20the%201st%20February%20at%2017%3A00.) for course applications is normally February 1st every year. This would suggest a link as to why there were more courses put forward in 2020 as it would have been prior to the pandemic and less in 2021 as the pandemic is ongoing. \n"

We already discovered from the count function that there were more courses on offer in 2020 than in 2021 or 2019. The [mean](https://www.cuemath.com/data/mean/) is calculated by adding all the points in the column togehter and dividing by the number of rows in that column. Therefore, this could explain why there would be a lower mean value in 2020. "
